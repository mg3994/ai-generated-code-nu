# Jet (Domain Layer)

This folder contains the **business‑logic** layer of the application:
- **dependencies/** – concrete implementations of infrastructure services (e.g., configuration, network, localization).
- **models/** – strongly‑typed domain entities using branded types.
- **intents/** – use‑case services (application services) that orchestrate domain logic.

The folder follows the hexagonal / DDD style described in the architecture overview.
